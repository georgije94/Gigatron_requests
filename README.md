# Gigatron_requests
Here is a little framework related to checking some checking requests on the Gigatron site. 
All logic is in function files, because of better maintenance I structured these files in that way, but it is not necessary. 
Here I did not use any test annotations, a library, or a reporting tool, I just used functions and ran them from the main function 
because of the easier flow of writing and reviewing. I used Python 3.7 and a basic logging.info logger for all messages. 
All results for all 6 requests should be visible on the Python Run Tool Window. 
For any questions about running this framework please contact me at georgije.kundacina@gmail.com
