# Gigatron_requests
Here is a little framework related to checking some checking requests on the Gigatron site.
All logic is in function files, because of better maintenance I structured these files in that way, but it is not necessary.
Here I did not use any test annotations, a library, or a reporting tool, I just used functions and ran them from the main function because of the easier flow of writing and reviewing.
I used Python 3.7 and a basic logging.info logger for all messages.
All results for all 6 requests should be visible on the Python Run Tool Window.
For any questions about running this framework please contact me at georgije.kundacina@gmail.com
